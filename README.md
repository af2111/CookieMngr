## About
This is an addon for the [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) game. It tries to fulfill all the clicking needs of the player. It almost eliminates the main objective of the game: to click.

As it may seems, it is not a cheating addon. It doesn't even use the techniques described in [Cheating | Cookie Clicker Wiki](http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Cheating).

## Install
You can either use a [userscript manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager) or the console of your browser.<br/>
Copy the content of `CookieMngr.js` and paste it in appropriate field. In case you don't have a [userscript manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager), you will have to use the console of your browser each time you play [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). That's it.
